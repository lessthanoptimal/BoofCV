 * Interface for processing and visualizing camera previews on Android devices. {@link VideoDisplayActivity}

 * arrives {@link #convertPreview} is called and very little time can be sent in this function or else the
 * application will crash. When the view is ready to be updated {@link #onDraw} is called, which should be
 * executed quickly to avoid slowing down the GUI. To accomplish for of these speed requirements it is
 * recommended that a new thread be launched and used to process incoming video data and compute the output.
