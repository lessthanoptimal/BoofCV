## Introduction

BoofCV is an open source real-time computer vision library written entirely in Java and released under the Apache License 2.0. Functionality includes low-level image processing, camera calibration, feature detection/tracking, structure-from-motion, classification, and recognition.

## Cloning GIT Repository

The bleeding edge source code can be obtained by cloning the git repository.

```
git clone -b SNAPSHOT --recursive https://github.com/lessthanoptimal/BoofCV.git boofcv
```

Is the data directory empty? That's because you didn't follow instructions and skipped --recursive. Fix that by doing the following.
```
cd boofcv
git submodule update --init --recursive
```

## Quick Start Examples and Demonstrations
To run BoofCV you need Java 11 or newer and any free version will work, e.g. [Zulu](https://www.azul.com/downloads/?package=jdk). To build BoofCV, just let the Gradle script handle everything. It will automatically download what it needs and ignore your local JDK if it's not compatible.

```bash
cd boofcv
git clean -fd main # Removes stale autogenerated code
./gradlew autogenerate
./gradlew examplesJar
java -jar examples/examples.jar
./gradlew demonstrationsJar
java -jar demonstrations/demonstrations.jar
```

All the code for examples and demonstrations is in boofcv/examples and boofcv/demonstrations. Example code is intended easy to understand, so look there first.

There you can calibrate cameras, create QR codes, batch scan for QR codes, batch downsample images, ... etc.

## Maven Central Repository

BoofCV is on [Maven Central](http://search.maven.org/) and can be easily added to your favorite build systems; Maven, Gradle, ... etc. It's divided up into many modules, but most people will just need 'boofcv-core'. Additional modules are listed below for GUI and IO components. To include it in a Gradle project add the following to your dependencies:

For Gradle projects:
```
dependencies {
    api(group: 'org.boofcv', name: 'boofcv-core', version: '0.42')
}
```

Here are a list of the most commonly used modules and what they are for:

------------------------------------
# Building from Source

Building and installing BoofCV into your local Maven repository is easy[1] using the [gradlew](https://docs.gradle.org/current/userguide/gradle_wrapper.html) script:
```bash
cd boofcv
git clean -fd main                # Removes stale autogenerated code
./gradlew autogenerate            # Creates auto generated files
./gradlew publishToMavenLocal     # Installs it into the local maven repository 
```
If you wish to have jars instead, the following commands are provided.
```bash
./gradlew oneJarBin               # Builds a single jar with all of BoofCV in it
./gradlew createLibraryDirectory  # Puts all jars and dependencies into boofcv/library
./gradlew alljavadoc              # Combines all JavaDoc from all sub-projects into a single set
```

[1] A couple of the integration submodules have a custom build process that can't be performed by Gradle. The script is smart enough to ignore modules and tell you that it is doing so if you haven't configured it yet.

## IntelliJ

IntelliJ is the recommended IDE for use with BoofCV. With IntelliJ you can directly import the Gradle project. 

1. File->Project From Existing Sources
2. Select your local "boofcv" directory
3. Confirm that you wish to import the Gradle project

## Eclipse

Similar to IntelliJ, you can now import Gradle projects like BoofCV using the Buildship tooling. [Instructions](https://www.vogella.com/tutorials/EclipseGradle/article.html)
