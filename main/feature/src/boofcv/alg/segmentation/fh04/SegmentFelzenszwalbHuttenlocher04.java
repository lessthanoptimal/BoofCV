/**
 * <p>
 * Implementation of Felzenszwalb-Huttenlocher [1] image segmentation algorithm. It is fast and uses a graph based
 * heuristic with a tuning parameter that can be used to adjust region size.  Regions are irregularly shaped.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * It works by constructing a graph in which pixels are the nodes and edges describe the relationship between
 * adjacent pixels.  Each pixel has a weight that is determined from the difference in pixel values using the F-norm.
 * The weights for all the edges are computed first and sorted from smallest to largest.  In the next step
 * the first edge in the list is selected and is tested to see if the nodes should be connected or not.  This
 * process is repeated for all edges.  Small regions are then merged into large ones. For more details
 * see [1].
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Region ID's in output image will NOT be sequential.  You need to call {@link #getRegionId()} to find
 * out what the ID's are.</li>
 * <li>The output image can't be a sub-image because it is used internally and needs to be a continuous
 * block of memory.</li>
 * <li>Pixel connectivity rule and weight metric is by the {@link FhEdgeWeights}
 * class passed in to the constructor.</li>
 * <li>To emulate the reference implementation use a </li>
 * </ul>
 * <pP>
 *
 * <p>
 * Algorithmic Changes:<br>
 * This implementation is a faithful of the original and has been compared against the authors
 * reference source code.  It does produce different results from the reference, some times significant, due to the
 * sensitivity of the algorithm to minor differences.  The sensitivity arises from it being a greedy algorithm.</p>
 *
 * <p>Here is a list of minor differences that cause different regions due to its sensitivity.  The order in which
 * edges with identical weights are sorted is arbitrary.  The order that edges are computed is arbitrary.  Floating
 * point error in weight calculation gradually causes segmentation to diverge to a different solution even
 * when given the same input.</p>
 *
 * <p>One difference from the original is that Gaussian blur is not applied to the input image by default.  That
 * should be done prior to the image being passed in.</p>
