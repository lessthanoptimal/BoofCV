/**
 * <p>
 * Scores the disparity for a point using multiple rectangular regions in an effort to reduce errors at object borders,
 * based off te 5 region algorithm described in [1]. Five overlapping regions are considered and the error at each
 * disparity is the center region plus the two regions with the smallest error. The idea is that only errors for
 * common elements in each image are considered.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Scores for individual subregions that the score is computed from are calculated in the same manor as
 * {@link DisparityBlockMatch}. Unlike those classes, a rolling window of scores for rectangular regions
 * is saved. From this rolling window of scores for the smaller rectangles the final score is computed by
 * sampling five regions as specified in [1]. The sum of the two best outer regions are added to the center region.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Since five regions are being sampled to compute the score the overall sample region is larger than the
 * individual sub regions. The border radius is thus twice the radius of the sub-regions.
