`sfm` submodule is composed of geometric algorithms that perform 3D reconstruction and pose estimation. These algorithms
tend to have more simplifying assumptions than what's in `reconstruction` and do not require more advanced
techniques that are in `recognition`. While primarily geometric in nature, there can be some image processing
and feature based approaches here.
