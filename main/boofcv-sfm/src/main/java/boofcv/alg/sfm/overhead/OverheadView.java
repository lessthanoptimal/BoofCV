/**
 * <p>
 * Data structure for an overhead orthogonal view with known metric properties. Each pixel in the overhead view corresponds
 * to a square of known size and location in the world. The each size of the square regions is specified
 * by cellSize and the origin by (centerX,centerY).
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The overhead +x axis corresponds to the world's +z axis and the image's +y axis corresponds to the world's -x axis.
 * The user specify the origin by changing centerX and centerY parameters. It is common to set centerX = 0 ,
 * centerY = output.height*cellSize/2.0.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * overhead pixels to world coordinates: (x,y) = (x_p,y_p)*cellSize - (centerX,centerY)<br>
 * world coordinates to overhead pixels: (x_p,y_p) = [(x,y) - (centerX,centerY)]/cellSize<br>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Notes:
 * <ul>
 *     <li>When rendering the overhead image objects to the left will appear on the right and the other way around. This
 * is an artifact that in image's it's standard for +y to point down (clock-wise of +x), while on 2D maps the standard
 * is +y being counter-clock-wise of +x.</li>
