/**
 * <P>
 * Interface for visual odometry from a single camera that provides 6-DOF pose. The camera is assumed
 * to be calibrated so that the "true" Euclidean motion can be extracted, up to a scale factor.
 * Motion can only be found up to a scale factor because it is impossible to distinguish between a
 * large motion and distant objects against a small motion and close objects when using a single camera.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Each time a new image arrives the function {@link #process} should be invoked and its return value
 * checked. If false is returned then {@link #isFault()} needs to be called to see if a fatal error
 * occurred. If a fatal error occurred then the motion estimate has been reset relative to the first
 * frame in which {@link #isFault} returns false.
