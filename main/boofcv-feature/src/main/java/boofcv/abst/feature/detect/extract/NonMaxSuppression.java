/**
 * <p>
 * Detects local minimums and/or maximums in an intensity image inside square regions. This is known as non-maximum
 * suppression. The detector can be configured to ignore pixels along the image border by a user specified distance.
 * Some implementations require candidate locations for the features. This allows for a sparse algorithm to be used,
 * resulting in a significant speed boost. Pixel values with a value of -Float.MAX_VALUE or Float.MAX_VALUE will
 * not be considered for local minimum/maximum, respectively. This is a good way to ignore previously detected
 * features.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Not all implementations will search for both minimums or maximums. Be sure you are using the correct one. If
 * you don't intend on detecting a minimum or maximum pass in null for the candidate list and the output found list.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An extractor which uses candidate features must always be provided them. However, an algorithm which does not
 * use candidate features will simply ignore that input and operate as usual. Can check capabilities at runtime
 * using the {@link #canDetectMinimums()} and {@link #canDetectMaximums()} functions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * A border can be specified around the outside of the image in which extremes can't be detected. However, a pixel
 * outside this border can influence if a pixel is a maximum inside, if the local search radius extends that far.
 * This is specified by the border parameter and the valid region is defined as follows:<br>
 * border &le; x &lt; width-border AND border &le; y &lt; height-border</p>
