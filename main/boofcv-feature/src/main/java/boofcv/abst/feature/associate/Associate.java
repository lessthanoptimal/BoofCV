/**
 * <p>
 * Common interface for associating features between two images. Found associations are returned in a list of
 * {@link AssociatedIndex} which specifies the index and score of the matching pair. Implementing classes can
 * optionally ensure that a unique pairing is found from source to destination and/or the reverse. See
 * functions {@link #uniqueSource()} and {@link #uniqueDestination()}. Indexes refer to the index in the input
 * list for source and destination lists. Inputs are not specified in this interface but are specified in a child
 * interface.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * DESIGN NOTES:<br>
 * <b>Indexes</b> of matching features are used instead of the descriptions because descriptions are often separated
 * from another more complex data structure and the index can be easily matched to that data.<br>
 * <b>Unassociated feature</b> lists can be easily computed using the returned set of associations. This functionality
 * is provided since in some cases it can be computed at virtually no cost during association.<br>
 * </p>
