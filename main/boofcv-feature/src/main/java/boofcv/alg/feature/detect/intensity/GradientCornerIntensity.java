/**

 * Several different types of corner detectors [1,2] all share the same initial processing steps. First a 2 by 2 deformation
 * matrix D = [ Ixx , Ixy ; Iyx , Iyy] is computed around each pixel. D is computed by summing up the product of each
 * pixel's gradient inside of a window. Next how corner like each pixel is computed using the information in the deformation
 * matrix. In the final step where each of these techniques differ.
 * <p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Ixx = Sum dX*dX<br>
 * Ixy = Iyx = Sum dX*dY<br>
 * Iyy = Sum dY*dY<br>
 * where the Sum is the sum across all the pixels within a rectangular window, and [dX,dY] is a pixel's gradient.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Alternative implementations can consider a weighted window around the pixel. By considering only a uniform set of
 * weights several optimizations are possible. The runtime is independent of the window size and can be very efficiently
 * computed.
