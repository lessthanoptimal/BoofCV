/**

 * Detects "blob" intensity using the image's second derivative. The Hessian (second derivative)
 * matrix is defined as [ I<sub>xx</sub> , I<sub>xy</sub> ; I<sub>xy</sub> , I<sub>yy</sub>],
 * where the subscript indicates a partial derivative of the input image. The trace and determinant of this matrix
 * is commonly used to detect interest point intensities. These tend to be at a peak for blobs
 * and circular type objects. The trace is commonly referred to as the Laplacian.
