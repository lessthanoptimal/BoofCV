/**
 * <p>
 * Implementation of the SURF feature descriptor, see [1]. SURF features are invariant to illumination, scale,
 * and orientation. Both the orientated and unoriented varieties can be computed.
 * SURF-64 describes an interest point using a 64 values that are computed from 16 sub regions. Each sub-region
 * contributes 4 features, the sum of dx,|dx|,dy,|dy|, where dx and dy are the local derivatives.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * To improve performance (stability and/or computational) there are a few (intentional) deviations from the original paper.
 * <ul>
 * <li>Haar wavelet or image derivative can be used.</li>
 * <li>Derivative sample coordinates are interpolated by rounding to the nearest integer.</li>
 * <li>Weighting function is applied to each sub region as a whole and not to each wavelet inside the sub
 * region. This allows the weight to be precomputed once. Unlikely to degrade quality significantly.</li>
 * </ul>
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Usage Notes:<br>
 * If the input image is floating point then normalizing it will very slightly improves stability. Normalization in
 * this situation means dividing the input image by the maximum pixel intensity value, typically 255. In stability
 * benchmarks it slightly change the results, but not enough to justify the runtime performance hit.
