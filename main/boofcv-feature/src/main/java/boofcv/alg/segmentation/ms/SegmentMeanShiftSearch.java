/**
 * <p>
 * Performs the search step in mean-shift image segmentation [1].  The mode of a pixel is the point at which mean-shift
 * converges when initialized at that pixel.  Pixels which have the same mode belong to the same segment. The weight
 * kernel G(|x-y|^2/h) has independent normalization factors h for spacial and color components.  A precomputed
 * Normal distribution is used for the weight kernel.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Output is provided in the form of an image where each pixel contains the index of a region the pixel belongs to.
 * Three other lists provide color value of the region, number of pixels in the region and the location
 * of the mean-shift peak for that region.  This output is unlikely to be final processing step since it will over
 * segment the image.  Merging of similar modes and pruning of small regions is a common next step.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * An approximation of running mean-shift on each pixel is performed if the 'fast' flag is set to true.  The
 * approximation is about 5x faster and works by saving the mean-shift trajectory [2].  All points along the trajectory
 * are given the same mode. When performing mean-shift if a pixel is encountered which has already been assigned a
 * mode the search stops. This approximation tends to produce more regions and reduces clustering quality in high
 * texture regions.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTES:
 * <ul>
 * <li>Spacial distance is normalized by dividing the found Euclidean distance squared by the maximum possible
 * Euclidean distance squared, thus ensuring it will be between 0 and 1.</li>
 * <li>Color distance is normalized by dividing it by the maximum allows Euclidean distance squared.  If its distance
 * is more than the maximum allowed value then G() will be zero.</li>
 * <li>Image edges are handled by truncating the spacial kernel.  This truncation
 * will create an asymmetric kernel, but there is really no good way to handle image edges.</li>
 * </ul>
