/**
 * <p>
 * Snaps a line to an edge of an object. The refined line attempts to maximize the absolute value of the
 * difference between the left and right sides of the line.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The algorithm works by sampling along the provided line segment. For each point along the line it also
 * samples points tangential to it in the left and right direction. When a point is sampled it is actually
 * the line integral between two points which are one pixel apart. The weight is found as the absolute value of
 * difference the between two adjacent line integrals along the tangent.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * Internally it will compute the solution in a local coordinate system to reduce numerical errors.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * DISTORTED INPUT IMAGE:  If the distortion is known it is possible to sample along a straight line in distorted
 * image space. This can be accomplished through the use of {@link #setTransform} where the provided transform
 * goes from undistorted pixel coordinates into the distorted input image.
