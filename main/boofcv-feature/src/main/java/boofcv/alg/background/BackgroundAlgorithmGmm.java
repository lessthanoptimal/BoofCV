/**
 * <p>
 * Background model in which each pixel is modeled as a Gaussian mixture model. The number of Gaussians in the
 * mixture is determined dynamically. If a pixel value is encountered which doesn't match any mixture then a
 * new Gaussian is added. Gaussians are removed when their weight becomes negative. See [1] for details.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>Tuning Parameters:</p>
 * <ul>
 * <li><b>learningPeriod:</b> Specifies how fast a Gaussian changes. Larger values is slower learning. Try 100</li>
 * <li><b>decayCoef:</b> Adjusts how quickly a Gaussian's weight is reduced. Try 0.001</li>
 * <li><b>maxGaussian:</b> Maximum number of Gaussian models. Try 10</li>
 * <li><b>initial variance</b> The initial variance assigned to pixels when they are first observed. By default this is
 * Float.MIN_VALUE.
 * </ul>
