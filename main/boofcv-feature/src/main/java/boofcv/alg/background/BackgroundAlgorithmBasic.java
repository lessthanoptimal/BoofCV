package boofcv.alg.background;

/**
 * <p>
 * Performs background subtraction on an image using the very simple per-pixel "basic" model, as described in [1].
 * A simple image is used to represent the background. Each pixel is updated individually using the formula below:<br>
 * <br>
 * B(i+1) = (1-&alpha;)*B(i) + &alpha;I(i)<br>
 * Where B is the background image, I is the current observed image, and &alpha; is the learning rate 0 to 1.
 * Where 0 is static and 1 is instant.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * If a specific pixel has not been observed before it will be set to the value of the equivalent pixel in the
 * input image.
