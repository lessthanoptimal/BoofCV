/**
 * <p>
 * Image pyramids represent an image at different resolution in a fine to coarse fashion. Lower layers
 * in the pyramid are at a higher resolution than the upper layers. The resolution of a layer is
 * specified by its scale. The scale number indicates how many pixels in the original input image
 * correspond to a single pixel at the current layer. So a layer with a scale of 5 is 5 times lower
 * resolution than the input layer.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * The transform from a pixel coordinate in layer 'i' to the original image will vary depending on the pyramid is
 * constructed. In general it, can be described by the following equation: (x,y) = (offX_i,offY_i) + scale_i*(x_i,y_i),
 * where (x_i,y_i) is the pixel coordinate in layer 'i'. The offsets (offX_i,offY_i) vary depending on how
 * each layer in the pyramid samples the previous layers. This offset can be found by calling {@link #getSampleOffset(int)}.
 * </p>
