/**
 * <p>
 * Moves an image template over the image and for each pixel computes a metric for how similar
 * that region is to template. An intensity image is thus computed for the entire image. Better
 * matches always have a more positive value. If a metric inheritally has a small value for
 * better matches then its sign will be adjusted so that poor matches have a negative value.
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * A pixel in the intensity image is the result of evaluating the template with its center over
 * that pixel. Given pixel (x,y) in the intensity image the template's top left corner (x',y') can be
 * found at: x' = x - getOffsetX() and y' = y - getOffsetY().
 * </p>
 * <p>
 * IMAGE BORDER: If the image border is processed or not depends on the implementation. If the border
 * is processed then partial templates are considered. If the border is not processed then the
 * value of the intensity along the border is not defined and should not be processed.
