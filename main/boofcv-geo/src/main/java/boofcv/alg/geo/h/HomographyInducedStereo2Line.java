/**
 * <p>
 * Computes the homography induced by a plane from 2 line correspondences. Works with both calibrated and
 * uncalibrated cameras. The Fundamental/Essential matrix must be known. The found homography will be from view 1
 * to view 2. The passed in Fundamental matrix must have the following properties for each set of
 * point correspondences: x2*F*x1 = 0, where x1 and x2 are views of the point in image 1 and image 2 respectively.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * Algorithm: For each line correspondence it finds the intersection between the two planes which define the observed
 * lines. These planes are created by line in the image and the camera origin. From the two found lines, the
 * equations of the plane are extracted in 3D space. This equation is then combined with information from
 * the fundamental matrix to compute the induced homography.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * NOTE: Any line which is parallel to camera baseline can't be used. The lines in both cameras will have the same
 * slope, causing their intersection to be a plane instead of a line. This can be a significant issue since for
 * many stereo rigs it would mean no perfectly horizontal lines can be used.
 * </p>
