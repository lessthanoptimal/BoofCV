/**
 * <p>
 * A related problem to the full P3P problem is to estimate the distance between the camera center and each of the 3
 * points being viewed. Once those distances are known the full 3D rigid body transform can be computed.
 * </p>
 *
 * <p>
 * More formally states the problem is: Three points (P1,P2,P3) in 3D space are observed in the image plane in
 * normalized image coordinates (obs1,obs2,obs3). The distance in 3D space between pairs of points (P1,P3), (P1,P2),
 * and (P2,P3) is known. Solve for the distance between the camera's origin and each of the three points.
