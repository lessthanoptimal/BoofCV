    - Root cause why it diverges if you consider too many images
    - Metric: Expand using 2-views
    - Metric: Initialize using 2-views
    - Ransac: Tell it the minimum threshold and abort early if it can't be meet?
    - Ransac: Specify max iterations using probability instead?
    * Pruning of views when creating pairwise graph. If too similar do not include it. Could be done before pairwise
      Should be able to process a video sequence where it's static for several frames

TODO PointTracker
  - Redesign PointTrackerTwoPass into PointTrackerHint
    * Could this be done by adding two functions: hint(motion) and undo() to undo the last association
  - Update Visual Odometry to use this new API when it makes sense
    * This would be similar to the old two-pass VO approach which got removed

   - Do everything that greedy does now
   - Take in max distance as a parameter too
   - Verify that it doesn't allow impossible associations either

NOTES: Format lint checks
 - Checkstyle can't be used since it does not allow for concise blocks and there is no built in way to just run on
   files that have been changed
 - Spotless is best option so far, but finding a flexible formatter is challenging. Might need to install eclipse

TODO Chessboard X-Corner

   - Add a flag to configuration to considered transposed markers
   - Change code so that the matrix is read in and saved

Less High Priority Next Release

- Concurrency
  * KLT
  * Association
  * Stereo disparity
  * Dense Features

- Filters
  * Median Filter: When even there's an number do average of two median terms

- 16-bit images
  * Binary Thresholding - Improved handling of 16-bit images

- Sparse Bundle Adjustment
  * Improve LM implementation so that it doesn't have to take a full gradient step if that's too big
  * sparse block math
  * parameterize rotation. Rotation +x unit vector  around Z then local Y. Use vector for axis-angle
    - 3 parameters, no normalization I think

- Polyline
  * Fit a large contour where only a small part of it is a square. Use found corners in fiducials
  * need to still be very fast and reject false positives

- Calibration Target Clustering
  * Random shapes can find their way into the grip
  * Needing to be able to process fisheye images makes it hard to disconnect
  * Compensating with thresholding and other methods which will degrade performance in other environments

    http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~stergios/papers/ICCV-11-DLS-PnP.pdf
    https://code.google.com/archive/p/dls-pnp-python/downloads

- Contour
  * Encode the direction of the next pixel in the contour instead of the pixel directly.
    Reduces memory overhead and is useful for shape analysis

- Fiducials
  * Detection:  Return bounding polygon in pixel coordinates (undistorted and distorted)?
  * Testing: Change generic unit tests to render the marker
             Render a marker with a lot of distortion.
             So much that it should fail if not corrected properly
  * Black Border:   See comment below

Future

- Dense Features
  * See if pruning low contrast regions improve scoring
    - Prune X fraction per image or global threshold across all images
    - Print debugging info to help with tuning?
  * See if different image sampling methods can improve scene recognition

- Fiducial Square
  * Regression tests that can determine if orientation is consistent
    - If multiple squares on same surface see if their orientation is the same
  * Image fiducial.  Look at all the images and compute pixel weighting of pattern based on variance.
                     Put all patterns which meet the correctness fraction then use the weighted sum to
                     select the winner.
  * For is black border black test, ignore the outer and inner most pixels to reduce false negative rate
  * Consider alternative algorithm for small (or all) squares.  Contour -> gradient -> cluster/hough
  * When optimizing the edges don't sample points tangent to the line sample points parallel to the adjacent sides
    that way it will sample inside the square more often.  Maybe interpolate between slope of both sides?
  * Look at alternative methods for generatng interpolated inner image.  bilinear is probably exagerating.  surface integral?

- Multi camera calibration using square binary patterns.

- Look at OpenCV's watershed example.  It's actually a useful technique!

- Background Model
  * Shadow removal
  * remove support for Planar once Interleaved is supported enough

- ImplSsdCorner_S16
  * Handle the border.  Currently is is just skipped
  * If the image is resized that will cause problems since the border can affect the location of local
    maximums
  * Create a generic function for handling borders?  Give it a function and it returns a solution?
